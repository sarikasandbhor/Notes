1) How we can broadcast message in IBM BPM?

2) User1,User2,User3 work on task and fill some data on form, if we are using multi-instance loop then how filled data by User1,2,3 can be visible for the User4 on one form?
	-> Add multi instance loop parallely, attach list of business object as an output to that activity like (tw.local.custDetails[tw.system.step.counter])
	-> This will form list of parallel instance
	
3) After closing task it should go back to work task custom page in process portal?

4) SOAP & REST difference?
	-> SOAP is a Simple Object Access Protocol, REST is a Representational State Transfer
	-> SOAP is a Protocol , REST is a Architectural Pattern
	-> SOAP can work with XML, REST can work with XML,JSON,Plain text,HTML etc.
	-> SOAP Requires more bandwidth coz it contains lot of info, REST requires less bandwidth for sending messages.

6) What is ajax service? Types of ajax services?

7) How to call/create instance of of one process app from other processapp?
	-> By message event -> Use same toolkit as dependency in both app which having UCA implemented
	-> By JavaScript API -> findProcessAppByName -> findProcessByName -> Input params & Call

8) What is TWSearch api? Uses?
	-> Define the columns of data that you want to retrieve.
	-> Define any filters that you want to apply to a column.
	-> Define the sort order for the returned records.
	-> Define how results are organized. 
	-> Execute the search and parse the results into a list of complex variables. 
	
9) How to call rest api from javascript?
	-> BaseURL
	-> Form Basic Auth passing username,password to new Packages.java.lang.String(username & password).getBytes() object
	-> Form URL using java.net.URL(rest url)
	-> Form urlConnection using url.openConnection()
	-> urlConnection.setRequestMethod(Get/Put/Post) and urlConnection.setRequestProperty(Pass BasicAuth in this) for authentication
	-> urlConnection.connect()
	-> urlConnection.getInputStream()
	-> bufferedReader()

	-> using jquery.min.js,bootstrap.js,bootstrap.min.css
	
11) If connectivity got lost then how to retry services in process after 10 mins dynamically?
12) Life cycle of coach view
	-> load - When the coach is run, the HTML is generated first and then the load() function is called to perform initialization logic, such as defining variables
			- child load() executes first
	-> View - After initialization is completed, the view() function is called before the user sees the view
	-> Change - The change() function reacts to changes in binding or configuration data
	-> Collaboration -  The collaboration(event) function is called if it is implemented, when multiple people work on the same view at the same time
	-> Validate - The validate(event) function is called when a boundary event occurs and its Fire Validation property is set to Before
	-> Unload - The unload() function is called when the coach view is removed from the coach
			  - The parent view's unload() method gets called before the child view's unload() method
	
13) Show() & SetEnabled() & setVisible()
	-> setVisible(false,false) //Hide
	-> setVisible(false,true) //None
	
14) Inside table show row data on click of corresponding button on row
	-> me.context._parent._rcdRef
	
15) Table vs service data table
	-> Service Data Table 
		- Service Data Table must specify a service flow with Ajax access that returns the data that will be displayed in the table. For this reason, do not bind the Service Data Table to a variable.
	-> Table
		- We just bind Business Object to display data

14) Difference bw ibm bpm and baw
	->
15) Ways to start process
	-> start message event, hit send message event from service/process
	-> Through script -> startProcessByName
	-> Through process portal -> Launch process
	-> Attach as linked Process
	
16) What is Tracking? Its uses? Ways for tracking?
	-> To create customized and third-party reports in IBM BPM, you identify the data to track and send that data to the Performance Data Warehouse.
	-> To track data in a process, use autotracking, tracking groups, or both.
	-> AutoTracking 
		- Autotracking automatically captures data from tracking points at the entry and exit of each item in a process 
	-> Tracking Groups
		- Tracking groups provide more control over tracked data
		- You can group variables that wanted to track

21)	What is Team retrieval service & Team Filter Service ?
	-> Team Retrieval Service
