WESB -> Websphere Enterprise Service Bus -> -> Below V7.0 are WESB -> Mounted on WAS(Websphere Application Server)
IID -> IBM Integration Designer -> Above v7.0 are IID -> Mounted on WPS(Websphere Process Server)
Process Designer -> It is BPM -> Above v8.5 has these features -> Mounted on Process Center
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All these 3 Mounted on Websphere Application Server(WAS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Overview of EAI,SOA
	1.1) EAI
		-> Enterprise Application Integration
		-> Enable the integration of software application & hardware systems.
		-> Communication of different applications
	1.2) SOA
		-> Service Oriented Architecture
		-> Divides application into different number of services, services communicate with each other & involve data passing
		-> Ex. Application is of Health Care, Retail
			-> Retail project -> Accounts & Orders
			-> Accounts -> Payment,Refund,Payment Successful,Payment Denied
			
2) Overview of WPS and WESB

3) SMO Structure
	-> Service Messaging Operator
	-> How the message flow that the SMO will tell
	-> 3 Parts:
	3.1) Co-relation context
		-> Maintain data across request & response flow
	3.2) Transient context
		-> Maintain data only during one direction either request & response
	3.2) Shared context
		-> FanOut & FanIn
			-> To execute looping functionality
		-> It is thread based storage area that shared in same thread
	
4) Bindings
	-> 4 type of Bindings:
	4.1) SCA Bindings
		-> Service Component Architecture
		-> Communicate with 2 services inside same workspace then use SCA Bindings
		-> Use to integrate 2 different modules using Import component (In client module)/Export component (In service provider)
	4.2) JMS Bindings
		-> Java Messaging Server
		-> Communicate through message, enables messaging based on Java Messaging Service API
	4.3) HTTP Bindings
		-> Put/Get/Post/Delete methods
		-> Transform data passed in message in native format to business object in SCA application and business object to native format.
	4.4) WebService Bindings
		-> Communicate with 2 services which are in 2 different workspaces then use WebService Bindings, Using REST & SOAP URLs
		
5) Adapters
	-> 4 types of adapters:
	5.1) Flat file Adapter
		-> Execute file which is there in your local, from local to call it to in your workspace
	5.2) FTP Adapter
		-> Execute file which is there in your remote location, from remote to call it to in your workspace
	5.3) JDBC Adapter
		-> For Database connectivity
	5.4) Email Adapter
		-> Trigger mail to automatically
		
6) Business Process Choreographer(BPC)
	-> In order to execute any human interaction in your service or in application we use BPC.
	
7) Human Tasks
	-> 3 types of Human Tasks:
	7.1) To-Do Task
		-> System is assigning task to the human to complete
	7.2) Invocation Task
		-> Human assigning task to system to complete it
	7.3) Collaboration Task
		-> Human to Human interaction (i.e. Levels of Approvals)
		
8) Faults in Business Process
	-> They are exceptions in BPEL Process and caught by Catch or CatchAll elements in Fault Handler
	-> In BPEL having Request,Response and Fault
	
9) Business Rules
	-> Conditions to develop particular service
	
Note:*
	-> along with IID DB2 database will get installed
